            <h1>Hey there! I am Bentheminernz and I'm a beginner/intermediate coder.</h1>
            <h2>As you may've seen before on the main screen I am learning HTML, CSS and Javascript (More Specifically p5.js) I also know a bit of Python.</h2>
            <h3>Recently I created this GitHub Page to share my findings and my progress with others and to keep track of what I've learnt and my progress I've made. I've been learning about Coding for at least 5 years now. I started on Scratch at first but then I learnt some Python and now I'm learning Web Development. One day I hope to land a job somewhere in coding development but for now I'm tinkering with what I know and sharing my knowledge with others.</h3>
