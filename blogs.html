            <h2>My Learning Logs:</h2>
            <h3>23/03/22</h3>
            <p>Currently figuring out how to properly set up this GitHub pages website. Need to figure out good way to show these logs. Also need to figure out how to include p5.js scripts and games as I am learning to how make those. Also need to figure out how to fix GitHub pages not updating after pushing new website commit update (Most likely a GitHub thing but will look into it.)</p>
            <h3>24/03/22</h3>
            <p>Managed to rehost this website on GitHub Desktop so it's easier push updates without using Command Line. Managed to create seperate pages on this website so these logs and the about is seperated. Also learnt how to link different HTML pages. Need to still figure out the page not updating correctly. Also need to figure out how to put p5.js games onto this website and fix them as they do not work correctly when I put the code into the p5.js website.</p>
            <h3>26/03/22</h3>
            <p>Sorry for not posting a log yesterday I was extremely busy fixing and adding stuff to this website. Now back to the log. Managed to add Games to this website, games are Spaceship Flappy Bird and Escape the Alien. Supposed to have another game like the chrome dino game but it's astronaut theme but it would not work when I added it to the site. Also had another Weekly coding lesson and learnt more stuff, working on a new game and learning some very important keycodes and movement code for p5.js games. Need to still fix the website not updating correctly problem, still can't find a answer annoyingly. Also adding those games took wayyy to long, wish I followed a tutorial instead of trying to go in blind thinking I can do it, which I managed to do but anyway will maybe take a break for a day or probably 1 hour LOL, from working on this site. </p>
